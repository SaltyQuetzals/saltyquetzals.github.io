      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        This was just a for-fun personal project that a friend and I built in
        our free time in Spring 2020. My friend had recently found the game
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a>, which
        is a real-time card game where people use pattern matching to identify
        groups of related cards. My friend and I wanted to experiment with some
        new web technologies, so we decided to build this game as a real-time
        multiplayer game.
      </p>

      <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
      <p>
        While Florian was experimenting with
        <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> on the frontend, I wanted to
        experiment with building a WebSocket server with solid type safety and
        high test coverage. Since this was going to be a small-scale project and
        didn't require an extreme amount of structure, I chose to go with
        <a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> for the backend,
        powered by <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. I chose to use
        <a href="https://socket.io">Socket.IO</a> to simplify the process of
        handling WebSockets.
      </p>
      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <h4>Socket Disconnections</h4>
      <p>
        One thing that became immediately important was handling random socket
        disconnections that could emerge whn a person switched networks, or
        minimized the browser window on their mobile device. If a person got
        disconnected and reconnected, they lost all of their points and progress
        and there was no way of getting them back. I didn't like the idea of
        storing information in an in-memory data structure that I arbitrarily
        designed, so we needed to actually store game data in a database so that
        we could retrieve it on-demand.
      </p>
      <h4>Keeping it Free</h4>
      <p>
        Since neither Florian nor I wanted to spend money on this project beyond
        a domain name, we had to figure out a way of hosting the frontend and
        WebSocket server for free. For the static content, we chose to use
        <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which lets
        developers host static content (like our frontend) for free. For the
        server, we chose to use <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, which
        let us have a server for free, but will turn it off after 15 minutes of
        inactivity until somebody tries to play the game again. It also let us
        get a small database for free, as long as we kept it small. Since we
        weren't anticipating this website blowing up, we decided we'd
        periodically clear out empty games in the database using a script, and
        that would keep us well within the free tier!
