        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          This was just a for-fun personal project that a friend and I built in
          our free time in Spring 2020. My friend had recently found the game
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)"
            target="_blank"
            >Set</a
          >, which is a real-time card game where people use pattern matching to
          identify groups of related cards. My friend and I wanted to experiment
          with some new web technologies, so we decided to build this game as a
          real-time multiplayer game.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
        <p>
          While Florian was experimenting with
          <a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank">Svelte</a> on the
          frontend, I wanted to experiment with building a WebSocket server with
          solid type safety and high test coverage. Since this was going to be a
          small-scale project and didn't require an extreme amount of structure,
          I chose to go with
          <a href="https://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>
          for the backend, powered by
          <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. I chose to
          use <a href="https://socket.io" target="_blank">Socket.IO</a> to
          simplify the process of handling WebSockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          To streamline the process of making changes to the game, I built an
          automated deployment system that compiled, tested, and deployed our
          code every time we pushed a change to GitHub. This significantly
          improved our overall developer experience, as each code change we made
          was live in a matter of minutes. Best of all? It didn't cost us a
          cent.

        <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
        <h4>Socket Disconnections</h4>
        <p>
          One thing that became immediately important was handling random socket
          disconnections that could emerge when a person switched networks, or
          minimized the browser window on their mobile device. If a person got
          disconnected and reconnected, they lost all of their points and
          progress and there was no way of getting them back. To persist data
          during socket disconnections, we set up a
          <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database, and
          used browser cookies to re-identify users.
        </p>
        <h4>Keeping it Free</h4>
        <p>
          Since neither Florian nor I wanted to spend money on this project
          beyond a domain name, we had to figure out a way of hosting the
          frontend and WebSocket server for free. Ultimately, we decided to host
          the frontend on
          <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>,
          and run the backend on
          <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, which let us
          operate comfortably within their free tiers.
