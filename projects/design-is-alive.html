        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          Design education frequently consists of open-ended, creative
          coursework that requires students to take risks, sometimes fail, and
          reflect on how to improve. As design students progressively develop
          and evaluate their solutions, their understanding of the problem
          improves, which improves their future solutions.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, design instructors lean on traditional digital submission
          and assessment systems to evaluate their students' work. While great
          for more close-ended work, these systems struggle to capture design
          students' iterative refinement process, instead presenting only static
          snapshots of a student's work before a submission deadline, making it
          difficult for instructors to evaluate their students' process, which
          they value more than the end solution.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>APPROACH</h2>
        <p>
          I used an
          <a href="https://livemache.ecologylab.net" target="_blank"
            >existing collaborative design software named LiveMâché</a
          >
          to study the iterative design habits of students, and determine how
          instructors interacted with their students' work. I developed
          functionality that allowed students to submit their work, instructors
          to see how a student's work changed over time, and annotate a
          student's work in real-time. I incorporated an email system to notify
          students and instructors of successful submissions. My features were
          deployed to two design courses (each around 15 students), one in South
          Korea at
          <a

            >KAIST</a
          >, and another at
          <a href="https://tamu.edu" target="_blank"
            >Texas A&amp;M University</a
          >
          in College Station, Texas.

        <p>
          Over the course of a semester, the system recorded how students and
          instructors were interacting with student work for later analysis.
          After the semester ended, I conducted semi-structured interviews with
          both students and instructors to find out what they thought of the
          functionality and whether or not they thought it helped them.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          Instructors reported that the functionality I developed helped them
          feel as though they were a part of the students' design process, and
          helped them feel more engaged in each students' work. Students
          reported that my features helped them reframe how they thought about
          their work, transforming it into a living work that transforms over
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, both students and instructors felt that certain
          features (like reviewing prevous submissions) could be improved to be
          on par with existing digital submission and assesment systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, what we found is that integrating assessment into the
          ideation process enhances students' and instructors' understandings of
          design processes and progress. Future design systems should enable
          instructors to leave feedback on designs and notify students, and let
          students notify instructors when feedback has been resolved.

        <h2>FUTURE WORK</h2>
        <p>
          This publication came from part of my undergraduate thesis, which is
          currently under embargo. Once my thesis leaves embargo, I can discuss
          the second semester's work, and will update this page with the
          remaining information.
