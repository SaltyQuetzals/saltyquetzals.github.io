      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I got my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Texas A&M, and like
        to believe that my degree gave me the technical chops to build solutions
        that help people. But I wasn’t sure how to identify what problems people
        needed solved, so I’m getting my Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction
        at Georgia Tech to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          learn how to identify real problems that real people have, and build
          cool things to solve them
        </li>
        <li>
          evaluate those solutions to see if they’re as useful as people need
          them to be, and
        </li>
        <li>avoid being an adult for a couple more years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I’d love for this conversation to be a bit less one-sided, so feel free
        to reach out to me!
