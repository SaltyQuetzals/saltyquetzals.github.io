        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          With COVID forcing me to spend more time at home, I had a whole lot
          more time on my hands and I wanted to keep my mind occupied during
          quarantine. One project that I had seen on GitHub was
          <a
            href="https://adamspannbauer.github.io/2017/12/28/super-smash-cv/"
            target="_blank"
            >Adam Spannbauer’s ssbm_fox_detector</a
          >, which uses machine learning to track a specific video game
          character on a tournament recording. I felt like the project’s focus
          was narrow, and wanted to expand it to include all of the characters
          in the video game, not just one!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          To accomplish my goal, I needed to think BIG. I needed to accomplish
          three things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get my hands on as many decent-quality tournament videos as I could
            find.
          </li>
          <li>
            Draw rectangles around each character visible on the screen on each
            video, and label each rectangle with the character’s name
          </li>
          <li>
            Feed all of my data into a program, and teach the program what each
            character looked like.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <h3>PART I: GETTING THE DATA</h3>
        <p>
          I went through a lot of trial and error figuring out how to get my
          hands on as many videos of Super Smash Bros Melee tournament matches
          as I could find. Ultimately, the approach I settled on was downloading
          those videos from YouTube, Twitch, and Vimeo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily for me, passionate fans of the Super Smash Bros. franchise had
          already built <a href="https://vods.co" target="_blank">vods.co</a>, a
          “comprehensive video archive of competitive gaming matches”.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../public/ssbmml/vodsco.png" />
          <figcaption>
            <a href="https://vods.co" target="_blank">vods.co</a>, the data
            source for the tournament videos I collected.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This site kept track of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The names of the people competing in a match</li>
          <li>The characters being played in the match</li>
          <li>The link to a video of the match</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I needed to go through every match on the site, find the corresponding
          video, and download it onto my desktop computer. It’d take too long to
          do that by hand (there’s tournament matches dating back to 2004), so I
          wrote a simple script that did that for me! All the program did was
          pretend to be a regular person using their computer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on each page of matches</li>
          <li>Click on each individual match on the page</li>
          <li>Extract the necessary data from the page</li>
          <li>
            Download the tournament video, keeping track of everything in a big
            spreadsheet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After I had the videos downloaded, I split each video into as many
          pictures as I could fit on my computer. Now all I had to do was draw
          rectangles around the Smash Bros. character in each picture!
        </p>
        <h3>PART II: PLEASE, NO MORE RECTANGLES</h3>
        <p>
          I downloaded hours and hours of videos, which transformed into
          hundreds of thousands of pictures. For each picture, rectangles needed
          to be drawn around all of the characters present on-screen. This was a
          lot of rectangles, too many for me to draw on my own by hand. I needed
          some help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, I had some awesome friends who told me about a process that
          would help me speed up my rectangle-drawing. The process is called
          bootstrapping, and to simplify it as much as possible, here’s how it
          works:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I needed to draw roughly 1,000 rectangles around characters by hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            I then needed to feed the rectangles into the program that I wanted
            to draw perfect rectangles.
          </li>
          <li>
            I pretend like the program knows what it’s talking about, and give
            it some pictures it hasn’t seen before, and ask it to draw
            rectangles for me. Since the program doesn’t know what the
            characters look like, it makes some pretty bad guesses. But it can
            draw bad rectangles really fast, which is better than nothing!
          </li>
          <li>I go through the program’s bad rectangles, and fix them up.</li>
          <li>
            I combine the fixed rectangles with my original rectangles, and now
            I have a lot more good rectangles!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now I just rinse and repeat, over and over, until I have enough
          rectangles!
        </p>
        <h3>PART III: THE EASY PART</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not a machine learning master, by any means. Rather than spend a
          ton of time learning about machine learning and get really in-depth
          about the subject, I tried to keep my knowledge shallow enough to move
          fast. So I went online,
          <a
            href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html"
            target="_blank"
            >found a tutorial</a
          >, and ripped out the parts I needed to get the job done. All that
          remained was to see how the results shook out!
