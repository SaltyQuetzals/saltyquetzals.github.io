        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          As part of Dr. Thad Starner's Mobile &amp; Ubiquitous Computing class,
          I was part of a four-person team that were given a research problem
          and asked to come up with a solution over the course of the semester.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          Group conversations can be difficult for people who are deaf or
          hard-of-hearing to participate in for a few reasons, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's hard to understand what's being said when more than one person
            speaks simultaneously
          </li>
          <li>
            It's difficult to interpret what people are saying when they're out
            of view
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Existing solutions like real-time captioning software are useful for
          one-on-one conversations, but are not as helpful in groups. Constantly
          looking at your phone to read transcriptions can also cause others to
          think you're being rude or inattentive. Recently, researchers have
          started using subtler technologies like
          <em>head-worn displays</em> (or smartglasses) to present captions
          discreetly, while allowing people with auditory impairments to keep
          their visual attention on the group conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, because of how prior research was conducted, it's hard to say
          whether one method of real-time captioning is better than another. My
          team was tasked with building a low-cost way of standardizing the
          evaluation process of these different solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any solution that we built would need to be easy to access (minimal/no
          download required), and be ecologically valid (meaning it actually
          reflected real-world group conversations).
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          Our solution is a 3D virtual environment where the participant is
          sitting at a round table with four other avatars who are performing
          Blair MacIntyre's
          <a
            href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/ael/projects/4am.html"
            target="_blank"
            >Four Angry Men</a
          >, a short script where jurors are discussing a court case. The
          participant is presented with a muted video recording of each juror
          saying their line, as well as a simultaneous caption of their words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than force the user to download a piece of software or expect
          them to have expensive equipment, we chose to build our software on
          the web, enabling easy access on mobile and desktop devices, as well
          as compatibility with VR headsets.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
        <p>
          When we decided to build our project using web technologies, we felt
          like it was unnecessary to re-invent the wheel and write a full VR
          engine from scratch, and looked for existing technologies that would
          be helpful in accomplishing our goal. Due to the limited amount of
          time we had to complete the project, we needed something that had a
          low learning curve, but also had enough flexibility to go beyond a
          simple toy project. We then stumbled upon
          <a href="https://aframe.io">A-Frame</a>, which allowed us to get setup
          quickly and let us make fast modifications by changing HTML elements.
          As a bonus, our app worked on desktop, mobile, and VR headsets!
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, it was simply a matter of building the scene we wanted to
          show the user, and then synchronizing video feeds with their captions,
          to simulate the effect of being in a group conversation.
        </p>
