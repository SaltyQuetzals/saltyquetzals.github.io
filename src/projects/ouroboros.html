        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://tamuhack.com" target="_blank">TAMUhack</a> is a
          student organization that hosts Texas' largest intercollegiate
          hackathon at Texas A&amp;M University every year. For 24 hours, 500+
          students from across the country gather at Texas A&amp;M to build
          prototype applications, and get free food, company merchandise, and
          potentially win big prizes.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          Until I joined the team in 2019, the TAMUhack team handled this large
          event's registration process manually:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Thousands of applicants submitted applications using
            <a href="https://typeform.com" target="_blank"> TypeForm </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Applications were manually reviewed by team members through Google
            Sheets
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceptance emails were written and distributed using
            <a href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Students who showed up on the day of the event were allowed entry if
            they were on a list
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          While this had worked for previous iterations of the event, the
          projected headcount for the 2020 event was approximately 700 students,
          not including sponsors and team members. In addition, the organizing
          team was hoping to get statistics on how much food was consumed at
          each meal during the event, and company workshop popularity metrics.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          I led the effort to design and develop
          <a href="https://github.com/tamuhack-org/Ouroboros" target="_blank"
            >Ouroboros</a
          >, an easy-to-deploy registration system designed with organizers in
          mind. Since its creation, Ouroboros has been used multiple times by
          different hackathon groups and has processed over 4,000 applications.

        <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
        <p>
          I had 3 main priorities that were fundamental to the design and
          implementation of the registration system: <em>extensibility</em>,
          <em>maintainability</em>, and <em>reliability</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Extensibility</h3>
        <p>
          TAMUhack is not unique in building a dedicated system to handle the
          registration process. The same task has been attempted again and again
          by various hackathon organizations across the country. However, the
          primary difference between Ouroboros and other hackathon registration
          systems is its initial and continued emphasis on configurability.
          Anything that could be considered specific to our event was abstracted
          into a variable or database table for others to modify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ouroboros is intended to be a general, minimal solution. The needs of
          the TAMUhack organizing team in 2020 aren't the same as the needs of
          other teams in the future. These events are constantly evolving, and
          it was immediately evident that every aspect of the system needed to
          be designed so that it could be built upon if someone else needed
          something specific or didn't want to include something.

        <p>
          To enforce modularity and extensibility, I chose to use
          <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> as its
          implementation language and
          <a href="https://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> for the
          web server. Python is renowned for its approachable syntax and shallow
          learning curve, making it an excellent choice for teams trying to get
          things done. The Django web framework takes an opinionated approach
          towards building software, forcing developers to comply with its
          constraints in exchange for out-of-the-box functionality that could
          easily be extended by other teams or future developers.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Maintainability</h3>
        <p>
          Ouroboros was started in February 2019, roughly one year before I
          graduated. I wanted development and improvement of the project to
          continue after my departure from the university, so ensuring that it
          could easily be handed off to others was critical. This meant
          including documentation, using familiar technologies (another
          determining factor for using Python), and teaching future tech team
          members how the application worked when it was my time to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since my last commit on April 17, 2020, the TAMUhack team has added
          1,430 lines of code and removed 49 (at time of writing). The team has
          also configured the system to work for two more events since my
          departure completely independently.
        </p>
        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <p>
          The registration process for a hackathon is arguably the most
          important process in the entire event. It gathers resumes to share
          with sponsors (which has a direct implication on fundraising for
          future years), facilitates day-of logistics, and represents the
          professionalism of the organizing team to both applicants and
          corporate partners. Any software that claims to handle such an
          important process effortlessly needs to be rock-solid in terms of
          reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          To that end, every feature developed for Ouroboros was built using a
          test-driven development mindset. Every feature that needed testing was
          tested on every change. Code that failed tests was not allowed to be
          deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure that our system was always available, I built an
          automated continuous integration pipeline that deployed the system to
          Google Cloud Platform every time a developer made a change. By
          automating the process, I made sure that whatever changes we thought
          were ready for launch were launched instantly.
